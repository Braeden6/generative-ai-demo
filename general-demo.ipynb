      " This paper presents an agent architecture that enables autonomous agents to spread invitations, make new acquaintances, and coordinate to attend a Valentine's Day party. Through ablation, the authors demonstrate that the components of the agent architecture (observation, planning, and reflection) are critical to the believability of the agent behavior. This work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling agents to interact with large language models.\n",
      "\n",
      " This paper explores the concept of Generative Agents, which are interactive simulations of human behavior.

      " For over four decades, researchers and practitioners have been working to create computational agents that can act as believable proxies of human behavior.

      " This paper introduces generative agents, which use generative models to simulate believable human behavior, and demonstrates that they can produce believable individual and group behavior. Generative agents are able to draw a wide range of inferences about themselves, other agents, and their environment in order to create plans and reactions that make sense in the long-term.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article discusses generative agents, which are agents that create daily plans that reflect their characteristics and experiences, act out those plans, and respond to changes in their environment or commands from the end user. Generative agents are capable of forming new relationships, diffusing information, and coordinating with other agents, leading to emergent social dynamics. An agent architecture is proposed to enable generative agents.\n",
      "\n",
      " This architecture uses a memory stream, retrieval model, and reflection to store, synthesize, and apply relevant memories to generate believable behavior. The memory stream records experiences in natural language, the retrieval model surfaces the records needed to inform the agent's behavior, and the reflection synthesizes memories into higher-level inferences.\n",

By connecting the architecture to the ChatGPT large language model, twenty five agents are manifested in a game environment. End users can observe and interact with these agents. With generative agents, it is sufficient to simply tell one agent to throw a party, such as a Valentine's Day party, instead of manually scripting the behavior of tens of characters.\n",
      "\n",

The evaluation leverages a methodological opportunity to \"interview\" the agents in natural language to probe their ability to stay in character, remember, plan, react, and reflect accurately. Ablations limiting agents' access to memory, reflection, and planning are compared, and it is observed that each of these components is critical to strong performance.\n",
      "\n",
      " This paper presents a novel architecture for generative agents that enables them to remember, retrieve, reflect, interact with other agents, and plan through dynamically evolving circumstances. It also identifies the most common errors that arise when the agent fails to retrieve relevant memories, fabricates embellishments to the agent’s memory, or inherits overly formal speech or behavior from the language model.\n",

      " This architecture combines the powerful prompting capabilities of large language models with additional components to support longer-term agent coherence, dynamic memory management, and recursive generation. Two evaluations were conducted to establish the importance of components of the architecture and identify breakdowns. The discussion also covers the opportunities and risks of generative agents in interactive systems, and how they should be tuned to mitigate risk.\n",
      "\n",
      " This paper discusses the use of parasocial relationships to mitigate risks from deepfakes and tailored persuasion, and how they can be applied to complement rather than replace human stakeholders in design processes. It reflects on prior literature in human-AI interaction and suggests that large language models, though not sufficient by themselves, can be used to build believable proxies of human behavior.\n",

      " This article discusses how interactive artificial intelligence systems can be used to combine human insights and capabilities in computational artifacts. It explores ways to allow users to interactively specify model behavior, such as through examples and/or demonstration. This opens up a new angle for creating believable agents.\n",
      "\n",
      " Recent research has explored the use of deep learning and prompt-based authoring in human-computer interaction. Formative work such as SHRDLU and ELIZA demonstrated the potential of natural language interaction with computing systems. Autonomous agents have been proposed as a new metaphor for delegation and interaction, and the boundaries between humans and agents have been debated and refined. This technology has recently become stable enough for practical use.\n",
      "\n",
      " This work examines the possibility of creating agents that can interact with humans via natural language in complex online social environments.

This work re-opens the door to examining foundational HCI questions around cognitive models, prototyping tools, and ubiquitous computing applications.\n",
      "\n",
      " Believable agents are designed to provide an illusion of life and act in ways that resemble human behavior. They can inhabit open-world environments and interact with users or other agents in order to become believable proxies of human behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      " Historically, agents have been developed to create NPCs with believable behavior in intelligent game environments. This could enhance player experiences by enabling emergent narratives and social interactions. Game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations of real-world affordances, and offer accessible testbeds for developers to finesse the agents’ cognitive capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      " Over the past four decades, a variety of approaches have been developed to create believable agents without the need for robotics or creating simulation environments. These approaches often simplify the environment or agent behavior to make the effort more manageable. Examples of these approaches include rule-based approaches such as finite-state machines.\n",
      "\n",
      " Trees are a straightforward way of creating simple agents that are still the most dominant approach today, and can even handle rudimentary social interactions. However, manually crafting behavior that can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interactions in an open world is not feasible, resulting in agent behaviors that may not fully represent the consequences of their actions.\n",
      "\n",
      " Traditional approaches for creating believable agents have been limited by the need for manual authoring, but recent learning-based approaches have achieved superhuman performance in games such as Starcraft and Dota 2. However, these approaches have not yet been applied to the challenge of creating agents for more complex tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      " Cognitive architectures, pioneered by Newell, were used to create believable agents in open world environments. Examples of these agents include Quakebot-SOAR, ICARUS, and TacAir-SOAR, which were used in first-person shooter games and aerial combat training simulations. These agents relied on SOAR, a cognitive architecture, to generate NPCs.\n",
      "\n",
      " Cognitive architectures such as ICARUS, SOAR, and ACT-R were inspired by the same underlying principle and maintained short-term and long-term memories. Agents created using these architectures aimed to be generalizable to open-world contexts and exhibited robust behavior, but their space of action was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      " Creating believable agents as described in its original definition remains an open problem. Existing approaches for creating believable agents are limited and cumbersome, but are good enough to support existing gameplay and interactions. Large language models offer an opportunity to re-examine these questions, with the potential to create more believable agents.\n",

      "\n",
      " We assigned \"no\" for both of a respondent's responses when they were unsure of who was running for election. In contrast, when Klaus Mueller responded positively to both questions, we assigned \"yes\" for both responses and verified that the agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the specific dialogue in their memory stream.\n",

      " This paper examines the diffusion path of Isabella Rodriguez's Valentine's Day party, which was heard about by 12 agents by the end of the simulation. The paper also confirms that affirmative responses from agents are not hallucinations by examining their memory stream. The question was asked once at the beginning and once at the end of the simulation.\n",
      "\n",
      " We measure the formation of relationships between agents by creating an undirected graph with 25 vertices and edges representing mutual knowledge. We calculate the network density and report the increase from the start to the end of the simulation. Finally, we study the agents' ability to coordinate with each other on group activities.\n",
      "\n",
      " This study observed emergent outcomes in a two-day simulation, where the number of agents who knew about Sam's mayoral candidacy increased from 4% to 32%, and the number of agents who knew about Isabella's party increased from 4% to 48%, without user intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      " This study observed the formation of new relationships among agents in a simulation, with the network density increasing from 0.167 to 0.74.

Seven agents were invited to the party.\n",

      " Generative Agents are increasingly having difficulty determining the appropriate space to execute an action due to the increasing number of locations they have learned about. As a result, some agents are choosing less typical locations for their actions, making their behavior less believable. For example, when deciding where to have lunch, some agents chose the bar instead of the cafe, even though the bar was intended for later in the day.\n",
      "\n",
      " We observed that agents were misclassifying proper behavior due to not understanding the physical norms of certain locations. For example, agents in a college dorm assumed that the bathroom could be occupied by more than one person, and agents in Smallville did not realize that certain places were closed after a certain time.\n",
      "\n",
      " This paper discusses the effects of instruction tuning on the behavior of agents in a simulated environment. It was observed that agents were more polite and cooperative when given specific instructions. Additionally, the paper suggests that adding norms to the state of the locations could help address issues such as agents entering stores after closing hours.\n",
      "\n",
      " Isabella was observed to have polite conversations with her husband John, always starting with a formal greeting and ending with a polite farewell. Additionally, the instruction tuning made the agents overly cooperative with one another, with Isabella rarely saying no to suggestions from other agents, even if they did not align with her own interests and characteristics.\n",

      " Isabella expressed an interest in English literature and has been exploring ways to promote creativity and innovation in her community.

      "\" Generative agents can be used to populate forums, virtual reality metaverses, and physical spaces with social robots. This allows for the creation of powerful simulations of human behavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, as well as create new interactive experiences.

      "\n",
      " This scenario proposes the use of generative agents as proxies for users, such as Sal, to learn and reflect their life patterns and behaviors. The agent can encode information such as Sal's daily routine and adjust the environment accordingly, such as brewing coffee, helping the kids get ready for school, and adjusting the music and lighting to match Sal's mood. This allows for a deeper understanding of the user.\n",
      "\n",
      " This paper presents a first instantiation of generative agents, which are designed to personalize and improve technological experiences based on user needs and preferences.

      " This study evaluated the behavior of generative agents over a short timescale, and found that it was costly and time-consuming to simulate 25 agents for two days. To improve real-time interactivity, parallelizing agents should be explored. Future research should observe the agents' behavior over a longer period to gain a better understanding of their capabilities and limitations, and varying and contrasting the underlying models should be considered.\n",

      "\" This paper introduces generative agents, a type of computational software, to create believable proxies of human behavior for interactive applications. It presents an agent architecture that uses a large language model to store experiences in natural language, synthesize memories into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them to plan behavior. This architecture is instantiated in an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where users can interact with a small town of twenty five. It evaluates the use of natural language agents to generate believable individual and social behaviors, and demonstrates that these agents can be used to create complex behaviors from a single user-specified notion. It also discusses the use of parasocial relationships to mitigate risks from deepfakes and tailored persuasion, and how they can be applied to complement rather than replace human stakeholders in design processes.\n",

      " This article discusses a generative agent architecture that uses a memory stream to store natural language descriptions of observations and reflections. It is used to simulate human behavior, such as planning a Valentine's Day party, and to generate dialogue between agents. The architecture is implemented in the Smallville sandbox game environment, which is built using the Phaser web game development framework. The server maintains a JSON data structure that contains information about each agent in the sandbox world.\n",

      " This paper discusses the use of generative agents, which use natural language to interact with a sandbox environment. The agents are equipped with a memory module to recall past experiences and answer questions. An experiment was conducted to compare the differences between ablated architectures and a full architecture over a two day simulation. The results showed that the full generative agent architecture produces more believable behavior than ablated architectures and the human crowdworkers. Additionally, instruction tuning was observed to make the agents more polite and cooperative. Potential applications, future work, limitations, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents are discussed.\n",
